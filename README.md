#Xp Publishing Workshop

This repository contains references and resources on experimental publishing.  
It was created at the occasion of a 2 days workshop given by LUST with BA and MA students from Graphic Design Arnhem, Piet Zwart Institute ExPub and PublishingLab interns, in October 2016.

##Purpose  
*Publishing* comes from Latin *publicare*, which means 'to make public'. Whenever we convey a message, from a source to a destination, we encapsulate this data in a specific form, chosen depending on our needs.   
  
In our digital realm, we consume and publish information every minute without even noticing it: we publish a picture on Instagram from the database of our smartphone, we post a comment on a newsfeed, we edit the description of our last item to sell on Ebay, we send an email to our friend…  
  
We are all publishers. We read, we write, we organize, comment, curate, publish all the time. We are users. But as designers, we can also act on this and create new publishing tools in order to satisfy different needs.   
This workshop aims to widen the scope of experimental publishing, by considering new tools. This work will be based on the analysis of specific study cases defined by the students.

##Assignement  
* As part of a group, come up with the idea of a project of experimental publishing (a workflow), which has to be realised whith one {or many, or all, or none} of the tools presented during the workshop.  
* Each workflow will require to designate clearly an input and an output.   
* Input will be: the World Wide Web.  
* Output will be: a proposal, a prototype, theoretical, a theory, a book, a video, an installation, a song, a program, a text, a poem, a social network, a platform, a website, a photograph, a performance, a movie, a theater play, a map, an internet protocol, a plain text or json.    
* Each project will question the notion of ***Filter***.\*      
#* In the end of the workshop, each group will present its project in a short lecture of 15 min.  
* Don't forget to keep track of your researches and experiments!
